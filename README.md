# mpanel-memory-graph

mPanel Memory Graph is a tiny utility for use with the BinaryLane and
Mammoth Cloud hosting services.

This is a rewrite to Rust from the original Python script
by Mammoth at https://github.com/MammothAU/mpanel-memory-graph.

Unlike the Python script, this does not need any runtime dependency at all
and is guaranteed to run on Linux at least.

Because this is written in Rust, it is guaranteed to be
blazingly 🔥 fast! 🚀
